# Chatbot using OpenAI API and Flask

<p>This project is a chatbot implementation using the OpenAI API for natural language processing and
the Flask framework in Python for the backend. The communication between the client and server is
facilitated through websockets using the Socket.IO library.</p>
<p>The chatbot's user interface (UI) is inspired by a CodePen design.</p>

## Project Structure

The project follows the following directory structure:

<img src="./src/static/img/tree.png">


## Getting Started

To run the chatbot locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the server: `python run.py`
4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8888` to access the chatbot UI.


## Configuration

The `config.py` file contains configuration parameters for the chatbot. You may modify this file to customize the behavior of the chatbot, such as setting the API keys for the OpenAI API or adjusting other settings.

## Usage

Once the chatbot is running, users can interact with it through the web interface. Messages are sent to the server via websockets, and the Flask backend processes the user input using the OpenAI API to generate appropriate responses.

## Deploying with Docker

You can also deploy the chatbot using Docker. A Dockerfile is provided for easy deployment. Follow these steps to deploy the chatbot using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t chatbot-app .`
2. Run the Docker container: `docker run -p 8888:8888 chatbot-app`

The chatbot will be accessible at `http://localhost:8888` just like when running locally.
